# Customer-Intent-Detection-using-NLP
Customer service teams receive thousands of customer messages daily. Manually identifying customer intent (e.g., complaint, inquiry, feedback) is time-consuming and inefficient. This project aims to automatically classify customer intent from text data using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning techniques.
Approach
Text cleaning and preprocessing
Tokenization and vectorization (TF-IDF)
Model training and evaluation
Intent prediction on new customer messages
Tech Stack
Python
Pandas, NumPy
NLTK / spaCy
Scikit-learn
Jupyter Notebook
Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-Score
Results
The model successfully classifies customer intent with an accuracy of XX% and performs well across different intent categories.
